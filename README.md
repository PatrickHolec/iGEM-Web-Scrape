Hi all!

The functions/scripts developed here were intended to interpret, pull and analyze content seen in search queries from Google through Python. This can allow scientists to get empirical data on how the public views certain issues, particularly those in biotechnology.

Ok, there's 1,000,001 uses for web scraping tools, but we are particularly interest in this application.

In any case, edit this file in either IDLE or an interpreter. There will be a blank program called "Run()", which can be filled with any and every combination of the searches/queries within the script. This will allow you to do potentially tricky analyses or data pulls if you start working with the functions intimately. Good luck, and I'll always be open to help someone out with the collection.

If you have any questions, comments, or want to talk about something interesting, please contact:
